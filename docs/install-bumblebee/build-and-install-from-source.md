# Build and Install From Source
To install Bumblebee directly on your OS first you'll need to the following packages and frameworks installed:
- Anaconda
- Jupyter Kernel Gateway
- Node.js 12
- MongoDB

To install Bumblebee first clone the repo using:

```
git clone https://github.com/ironmussa/Bumblebee.git
cd Bumblebee
```

Then you'll be able to start the environment using the following command (Linux only):

```
bash bbi.sh start environment
```

Youâ€™ll be asked to input your public address. It must be your external server IP address if you're hosting your Bumblebee project. if you want to use `localhost` instead, just press Enter.
